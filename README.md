# SOCI Installer

The SOCI "Seekable OCI" Snapshotter is provided via [awslabs/soci-snapshotter](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter) and is a containerd plugin that allows you to pull your containers (in layman's terms) "wicked fast." You can read more about the design and work done e.g.,:

> [Harter et al FAST '16](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast16/technical-sessions/presentation/harter) found that image download accounts for 76% of container startup time, but on average only 6.4% of the fetched data is actually needed for the container to start doing useful work.

in the repository [README there](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter). The author of this project noted that [image streaming was available on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/image-streaming) but didn't seem to be on AWS. Thus, it provides a daemonset to install the service to nodes, and the other detail is that your registry needs to support the referrer's API to upload the associated artifacts with archive indexes.

## Usage

To install to your cluster, you should create it first! There is an [example](example) provided using eksctl. Then install the daemonset. 

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./daemonset-installer.yaml
```

The scripts are built into the container, so if you need to update or change something, just do it there. Note that you can change the version as the only argument to the entrypoint. This should coincide with a GitHub release (tag). Then you can create a pod with a big container:

```bash
kubectl apply -f example/pod.yaml
```

If you look at kubectl events, it will pull in ~4 seconds.

```console

```

If we didn't use SOCI, it would take ~71 seconds.

```console

  Normal  Started    13s   kubelet            Started container soci-container
```

If you look at the logs of the daemonset, the first round will install soci and restart containerd. Since that will kill the nsenter pod, it goes in again, and then pulls the needed sandbox container. 

## Debugging

After `kubectl node-shell` into the node and `nsenter -t 1 -m bash` here are some [commands](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/debug.md) I use to see what is going on:

```console
# Is the snapshotter recognized by containerd?
sudo ctr plugin ls id==soci

# log
sudo journalctl -u soci-snapshotter.unit
```

## Previous Art ðŸŽ¨

The repository provides a set of [setup instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/eks.md) with a NodeConfig and a lot of manual steps, but I wanted the entire thing as a daemonset.

## Limitations

This does not currently support [registry authentication](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/kubernetes.md#registry-authentication-configuration) (meaning private images) but it could. It also is intended for AWS, because that's the cloud I have access to (that doesn't have a command line flag to enable it). Other clouds could be added, and the approach here improved upon. I made this quickly in the morning before a bike ride so it's not perfect.
